Pune (India) witnessed probably the second biggest [PyCon][1] event this year. It was third PyCon to be held in India and was very successfull event.

I took a comprehensive tutorial on [Redis & Python][2]Â subject. I am embedding the slides from the same session below.

Hope you will find it useful. Ping me [@_sunil_][3] if you have any questions.
