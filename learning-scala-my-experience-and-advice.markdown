Learning a new programming language has been on my list quite sometime and fortunately, I got a chance to try out Scala for one of the projects at work a month back. So, its been a month learning Scala now. Though its too early to form an opinion about it, but I must say, it has NOT been an easy language to learn so far.  And I think one of the reasons for that is -- the language is way too expressive with pretty much all the constructs in the basket and that makes it a very powerful tool but a difficult one to master. So one advice, don't get disappointed if you feel lost and be patient while you are learning it because it is going to take a bit longer than you expected, so hang in there!!!


As I am on this journey, I am discovering some useful resources everyday, so I thought of documenting them in a blog post. I plan to maintain this blog post as a living document.

### Books: 

If you are looking for a quick introduction to the language, I would recommend ["Scala for Impatient"][1] by Cay S. Horstmann. It is well written book with right balance of content explaining key concepts and their application. But if you are in for a long and patient read, ["][2][Programming in Scala][2]["][2] by Martin Odersky is a good read which explains the key concepts on a much more fundamental and detailed level. I am using both the books  and cross reference depending upon the details I want to dive in to a particular topic. I am yet to explore other books, but these two makes a good start. The good thing is that both of them are available in kindle version.

### Video Lectures: 

If you like attending video course, then there is a very good course ["Functional Programming Principles in Scala"][3]  by Martin Odersky on Coursera. The course is divided in to video lectures of 10-20 minutes length, which makes them easy to consume.

### Blogs/Online Articles: 

There are some really useful blog post out there about scala, but a few deserve special mention here.

### Tooling: 

Eclipse and IntelliJ Idea, both of them, have a good support for scala. In my case, I end up using IntelliJ for my day to day coding, but eclipse has a very good support for Scala worksheet, which I find really handy to try and learn new concepts. For some reason, scala worksheets does not work in IntelliJ Idea. I also use Vim for some quick editing etc and I found vim-scala plugin pretty handy.

Let me know what has been your experience learning Scala and chime in with links to resources which you found useful.
