Very recently, I started my journey in big data world and its exciting time to see new technologies popping up these days. I came across this really handy tool which I used in my project at work. Its called [Drake][1], Make for Data as factual folks call it. You can read more about it in their [blog post][2] . 

I will write up a detailed post about how I used Drake to simplify my life at work but in the mean time, I wanted to share this very good introductory video by [Artem Boytsov][3] the author himself.

I would highly recommend it to anyone to add it to his toolkit if you are dealing with complex data workflows in your project. Have a look and let me know what you think!!!
