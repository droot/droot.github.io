Its been quite a while since I wrote my last blog post and for a change, this time I am not going to talk anything technical :). Actually, the idea of writing this blog post got triggered from the feeling that I had when I finished watching "Udaan -by Anurag Kashyap's production house" at Inox today. Then, when I came home, 3 Idiots was being screened on TV. There's been quite a few movies that I can count which shivered me from inside and forced me into thinking hard about life and whether I AM LIVING IT RIGHT ? These are some of the movies which shake old age fundamentals which most of us have been brought up with.

So in today's blog post, I am going to celebrate this feeling of freedom and "TAKE ON THE WORLD" spirit and would like to refresh the thoughts and spirit that these movies carry. The best song to set the theme would be "Pankhon ko..." from Rocket Singh. Its a beautiful song and with so thoughtful lyrics by Jaideep Sahni. Enjoy!!!

> Pankhon ko hawa zara si lagne do
Dil bole soya tha ab jagne do
Dil dil mein hain dil ki tammana sau
Do sau hon chalo zara sa tapne do
Udne do udne do
Hawa zara si lagne do soya tha ab jagne do
Pankhon ko hawa zara si lagne do

> Dhoop khili jism garam sa hai
Suraj yahin yeh bharam sa hai
Bikhri huyi raahein hazaron sau
Thaamo koi phir bhatakne do
Udne do udne do  Dil ki patang chahon mein gotey khaati hai
Dheel toh do dekho kahan pe jaati hai
Uljhe nahin toh kaise suljhoge
Bikhre nahin toh kaise nikhroge
Udne do udne do
