While browsing URL-Shortner's website ([awe.sm][1]), I came across this presentation discussing how people-web(social-media driven web) is different from page-web (web 1.0).

Its a very good presentation discussing attributes of people-web. Author also shares some statistics comparing search engines and social media sites as traffic drivers.
