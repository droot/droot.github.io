Learning a new programming language has been on my list quite sometime and
fortunately, I got a chance to try out Scala for one of the projects at work a
month back. So, its been a month learning Scala now. Though its too early to
form an opinion about it, but I must say, it has NOT been an easy language to
learn so far.  And I think one of the reasons for that is -- the language is
way too expressive with pretty much all the constructs in the basket and that
makes it a very powerful tool but a difficult one to master. So one advice,
don’t get disappointed if you feel lost and be patient while you are learning
it because it is going to take a bit longer than you expected, so hang in
there!!!

As I am on this journey, I am discovering some useful resources everyday, so I
thought of documenting them in a blog post. I plan to maintain this blog post
as a living document.

Books: 

If you are looking for a quick introduction to the language, I would recommend
“Scala for Impatient” by Cay S. Horstmann. It is well written book with right
balance of content explaining key concepts and their application. But if you
are in for a long and patient read, “Programming in Scala” by Martin Odersky is
a good read which explains the key concepts on a much more fundamental and
detailed level. I am using both the books  and cross reference depending upon
the details I want to dive in to a particular topic. I am yet to explore other
books, but these two makes a good start. The good thing is that both of them
are available in kindle version.

Video Lectures: 

If you like attending video course, then there is a very good course
“Functional Programming Principles in Scala”  by Martin Odersky on Coursera.
The course is divided in to video lectures of 10-20 minutes length, which makes
them easy to consume.
Blogs/Online Articles: 

There are some really useful blog post out there about scala, but a few deserve
special mention here.
Blog series called “The Neophyte’s Guide to Scala” by Daniel Westheide

Scala Documentation 

Twitter Scala School

Effective Scala

Tooling: 

Eclipse and IntelliJ Idea, both of them, have a good support for scala. In my
case, I end up using IntelliJ for my day to day coding, but eclipse has a very
good support for Scala worksheet, which I find really handy to try and learn
new concepts. For some reason, scala worksheets does not work in IntelliJ Idea.
I also use Vim for some quick editing etc and I found vim-scala plugin pretty
handy.

Let me know what has been your experience learning Scala and chime in with
links to resources which you found useful.
