        NewRelic's default conf drags Play Scala app 
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 Jun 2014</span>

    <p>Last week I learned about an important tweak in NewRelic configuration to avoid performance issues with Play Scala webframework.</p>

<p>While benchmarking our play-scala app I was surprised to see poor performance numbers given that play framework claims to be one of high performant web frameworks around.
App wasn&#39;t able to serve more than 200~230 requests per seconds for a simple DB lookup operation. Some serious digging revealed that default configuration of NewRelic for Play framework adds serious drag to the app&#39;s performance.</p>

<p>I contacted folks at NewRelic and they were quick to respond. Here is what I learned from them about the instrumentation: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In order to properly track async activity, we instrument Scala promises and
futures. Unfortunately naming the tracers using these classes are not helpful
at all. In effort to improve trace segment naming, I take a Thread.stacktrace
and navigate up the stack to find a useful caller and name based on that. The
call to Thread.stacktrace can be relatively expensive and result in
significant overhead. The setting we suggested disables this functionality and
has reduced overhead significantly for several other customers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, all you need to do is to turn off <em>stack<em>based</em>naming</em> in your newrelic.yml. Remember to put this configuration under transaction_tracer section.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="python">  <span class="n">transaction_tracer</span><span class="p">:</span>
      <span class="n">stack_based_naming</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">false</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here is a side by side comparison of running Apache Benchmark (ab) with 10K requests with concurrency of 10 with/without the configuration tweak.</p>

<p><img src="/public/new_relic_play_configuration_tweak.png" ></p>

<p>You can see the difference in throughput <em>1300 requests per second</em> vs <em>220 requests per second</em>.</p>

<p>NewRelic should turn off <em>stack<em>based</em>naming</em> setting by default. </p>

<p>Hope you find this tip helpful. If I had known about it, it would have saved me couple of days :).</p>

    <span class="post-date">08 Apr 2014</span>

    <p>I spent this weekend learning more about Scala Futures, and believe me, posts
below are the best written introductory posts about scala futures and promises.</p>

<ul>

        Learning Scala -- my experience and advice
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Dec 2013</span>

    <p>Learning a new programming language has been on my list quite sometime and fortunately, I got a chance to try out Scala for one of the projects at work a month back. So, its been a month learning Scala now. Though its too early to form an opinion about it, but I must say, it has NOT been an easy language to learn so far.  And I think one of the reasons for that is -- the language is way too expressive with pretty much all the constructs in the basket and that makes it a very powerful tool but a difficult one to master. So one advice, don&#39;t get disappointed if you feel lost and be patient while you are learning it because it is going to take a bit longer than you expected, so hang in there!!!</p>

<p>As I am on this journey, I am discovering some useful resources everyday, so I thought of documenting them in a blog post. I plan to maintain this blog post as a living document.</p>

<h3>Books: </h3>

<p>If you are looking for a quick introduction to the language, I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scala-Impatient-Cay-S-Horstmann/dp/0321774094/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387653919&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=scala+for+impatient">&quot;Scala for Impatient&quot;</a> by Cay S. Horstmann. It is well written book with right balance of content explaining key concepts and their application. But if you are in for a long and patient read, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Scala-Comprehensive-Step---Step/dp/0981531644/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387654246&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Programming+in+scala">&quot;</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Scala-Comprehensive-Step---Step/dp/0981531644/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387654246&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Programming+in+scala">Programming in Scala</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Scala-Comprehensive-Step---Step/dp/0981531644/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1387654246&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Programming+in+scala">&quot;</a> by Martin Odersky is a good read which explains the key concepts on a much more fundamental and detailed level. I am using both the books  and cross reference depending upon the details I want to dive in to a particular topic. I am yet to explore other books, but these two makes a good start. The good thing is that both of them are available in kindle version.</p>

<h3>Video Lectures: </h3>

<p>If you like attending video course, then there is a very good course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun" title="Link: https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun">&quot;Functional Programming Principles in Scala&quot;</a>  by Martin Odersky on Coursera. The course is divided in to video lectures of 10-20 minutes length, which makes them easy to consume.</p>

<h3>Blogs/Online Articles: </h3>

<p>There are some really useful blog post out there about scala, but a few deserve special mention here.</p>

<ul>
<li>Blog series called <a href="http://danielwestheide.com/scala/neophytes.html">“The Neophyte’s Guide to Scala”</a> by Daniel Westheide</li>
<li><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/documentation/">Scala Documentation</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.github.io/scala_school/">Twitter Scala School</a></li>
<li><a href="http://twitter.github.io/effectivescala/">Effective Scala</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Tooling: </h3>

<p>Eclipse and IntelliJ Idea, both of them, have a good support for scala. In my case, I end up using IntelliJ for my day to day coding, but eclipse has a very good support for Scala worksheet, which I find really handy to try and learn new concepts. For some reason, scala worksheets does not work in IntelliJ Idea. I also use Vim for some quick editing etc and I found vim-scala plugin pretty handy.</p>

<p>Let me know what has been your experience learning Scala and chime in with links to resources which you found useful.</p>

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 Sep 2013</span>

    <p>Very recently, I started my journey in big data world and its exciting time to see new technologies popping up these days. I came across this really handy tool which I used in my project at work. Its called <a href="https://github.com/Factual/drake" title="Link: https://github.com/Factual/drake">Drake</a>, Make for Data as factual folks call it. You can read more about it in their <a href="http://blog.factual.com/introducing-drake-a-kind-of-make-for-data">blog post</a> . </p>

<p>I will write up a detailed post about how I used Drake to simplify my life at work but in the mean time, I wanted to share this very good introductory video by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/aboytsov?feature=watch">Artem Boytsov</a> the author himself.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BUgxmvpuKAs"

<p>I would highly recommend it to anyone to add it to his toolkit if you are dealing with complex data workflows in your project. Have a look and let me know what you think!!!</p>

        Highlight Call to Action by giving a small Wiggle
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Mar 2013</span>

    <p>Today, when I was trying out a new application <a href="http://bufferapp.com/">bufferapp</a>, I noticed something very interesting in their interface which immediately caught my attention. Although it is a tiny little detail about the interface, but I think it is one of the very important ones especially in context of a web app, so I thought of writing it down.</p>

<p>If you have used bufferapp, you will notice following things (shown in the picture below):</p>

<ul>
<li>High level navigation at the top (header section).</li>
<li>Notification with some call to action right beneath the header section (in this case Install Chrome extension)</li>
<li>Main content section which is about buffering your tweets. </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://phaven-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/files/image_part/asset/29299/SJdP9iq-WbjZoN04vhLbZQDvDsU/medium_Wiggle_Example.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The detail that I wanted to point out was, when I am navigating from bottom section to the header section, I would see &quot;install&quot; button wiggles for a moment. Now that momentary wiggle made me pay attention and read that message to understand install what ?  It felt exactly like as if you are navigating through your office corridor and someone calls you out to show you something. So this &quot;wiggle for .2 seconds&quot; was almost like someone calling out to make sure I read that message. You can see this in action <a href="http://droot.github.com/wiggle/">here</a> in modern browsers specifically Chrome, Safari or Firefox.</p>

<p>You will see this layout pattern in lot of places where application is trying to communicate something important to the user and would like him/her to take an action like in this case Buffer wanted me to install their chrome extension as I was using Google Chrome. Typically, users develop a blind eye to some of these layout patterns and it becomes very challenging for the interface designer to craft an experience which could draw user&#39;s attention to an important action.</p>

<p>These simple but important details separates a good design from a great design. In rest part of the post, I would throw some light on implementation details for this wiggle effect. Most of the modern browsers support animation through CSS3 these days.</p>

<p>keyframe definition for wiggle effect would look like this: (omitting the browser prefix for better readability)</p>

<p>Think of keyframes directive as defining a animation function which will be called later on elements like buttons in our UI. We implement wiggle function by first rotating the subject by 2 degree anticlockwise, then to 2 degree clockwise and then rotate it back by 2 degree anticlockwise.</p>

<p>Let say our html markup for flash message looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="html"><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;flash_message&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  Install Now
<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Inorder to invoke it on a mouseover of the flash message block. Our invokation code in CSS would look like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="css"><span class="nc">.flash_message</span><span class="nd">:hover</span> <span class="nt">a</span><span class="nc">.call_to_action</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="n">animation</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">wiggle</span> <span class="m">0.2s</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is a classic example of applying CSS3 techniques at the experience layer in your application. Let me know what you think of such experiences, drop a note below in the comment section or tweet me <a href="http://twitter.com/_sunil_">@<em>sunil</em></a> .</p>
